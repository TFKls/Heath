A scheme interpreter, made to better understand Haskell.

This interpreter has been written alongside the [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours.pdf) book.

It is however planned to be a full [R7RS](https://small.r7rs.org/attachment/r7rs.pdf) compliant scheme implementation down the line. (It is not one yet)
